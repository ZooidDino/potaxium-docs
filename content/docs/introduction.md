Potaxium is the state-of-the-art finance API to get realtime financial data on forex, materials (e.g., gold, silver)
and cryptocurrencies.

Unlike our competitors, we directly aggregate financial data from hundreds of providers (such as exchanges, central banks,
forex brokers, international banks) and make it redundantly available to those who choose to use the service, reducing
possible API downtime.

You won't have to worry about anything other than calling our API, we use only reliable sources, and we update
our systems constantly to prevent any incorrect data, with the help of our real time filters.

We don't ask you to take our word for it, you can evaluate our service by signing up directly for the free version
of our API, and then decide whether to upgrade to a higher plan.

## What makes us different
- Attention to personalized customer needs
- Realtime financial data for more advanced [service plans](/docs/pricing)
- Affordable prices starting from $7.50/month
- We support 200+ currencies
